    Workshop abstract
    
    In recent years, robotics have experienced remarkable progress in terms of hardware for real-world manipulation. While new architectures—such as supernumerary robots, multi-arm aerial and loco-manipulation, and humanoids—are emerging and becoming more prevalent, their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Humanoids, for example, can perform impressive free-motion tasks like backflips and frontflips, yet they still rely heavily on pre-scripted motions or teleoperation, especially for tasks requiring coordinated multi-arm manipulation. This dependence makes them inflexible in dynamic, unstructured environments.
    
    This workshop aims to push these boundaries by discussing and addressing a key question:
    
    What are the main challenges and potential solutions in leveraging both state-of-the-art model-based and model-free methods (successful for single-arms) to enhance the capabilities of these new multi-arm designs?
    
    Discussions will focus on a comprehensive set of challenges and solutions, with expert-led insights into:
    
    Multi-arm tasks in the real-world: A taxonomy of tasks are there for the robots;
    Multi-arm and whole-body coordination: Ensuring certified and adaptive behavior;
    Impact-aware manipulation: Enabling realistic real-time interactions;
    Learning and demonstration: Teaching new multi-arm tasks efficiently;
    Human-robot collaboration: A supernumerary perspective on multi-arm teamwork.
    A prominent theme throughout the workshop is interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together the expertise of engineers, academics, industry partners, alongside early-career researchers. It will serve as a platform for sharing knowledge, defining benchmarks, and shaping the future of dynamic, intelligent, and real-world-ready multi-limb robotic systems. By integrating these perspectives into an interdisciplinary approach, this workshop seeks to drive tangible progress in multi-arm manipulation research and real-world deployment.

    Summary
    Advances in robotics, perception, and artificial intelligence are driving the expectation of robots having high-level capabilities to autonomously, accurately, and robustly address various tasks. However, crucial robotic capabilities such as autonomous assembly and disassembly, cloth manipulation, in-hand manipulation, object picking in cluttered environments, or object hand-over are far from being solved. Many research activities have focused on these subject topics over the last decades, but solutions remained limited, and results are demonstrated on custom workflows and validation tests designed in individual laboratories considering distinct modalities and performance criteria. For this reason, benchmarking is important to enable reproducibility and comparison across different solutions and to advance the developments in challenging robotic manipulation problems. In addition, competitions have been an effective way to drive scientific progress in recent years, spurring the advances in robotics research. This workshop aims to stimulate discussions within the research community from both academia and industry on the current and future challenges of autonomous robotic grasping and manipulation for real-world applications where research innovation meets engineering solutions for developing efficient and elegant systems in relevant environments outside the laboratory with particular attention to benchmarking and competitions. To this end, we will engage with experts on the tasks and the winners of recent competitions. We will draw guidelines and directions for the reproducibility and comparison of future solutions and new challenges that arise from the discussion.

- 2nd Human Modeling Workshop: AI-Powered Human Modeling for Healthcare, 人类运动分析, 医疗机器人
    
    https://sites.google.com/view/iros25-human-modelling-ai/home
    
    Human modeling is crucial in healthcare robotics. However, the daunting complexity of human neuromusculoskeletal systems greatly limits the widespread adoption of human modeling to bring actual benefits to individuals in this human-centered robotics area. One important challenge lies in the high dimensionality and redundancy of the human motor actuation space, i.e., around 200 joints in the human body are driven by over 650 skeletal muscles, which are controlled by hundreds of thousands of motor neurons. Although optimal feedback control, a concept borrowed from control theory, is a good starting framework for understanding general human motor control mechanisms, the curse of dimensionality renders significant difficulties in using traditional control theory and/or optimization techniques to decode human motor control strategies and skills of individuals whose neuromusculoskeletal systems exhibit large variability and nonstationarity.
    
    AI techniques, especially deep learning based methods, can provide promising solutions to human modeling problems. For example, researchers recently started investigating utilizing deep reinforcement learning with minimum assumptions and sensors to synthesize and individualize human movements like grasping, arm manipulation, walking, and running. The decoded human motor control can be used for robotic health monitoring or personalized robotic assistance. On the other hand, when the human body is considered as part of the unknown environment for the collaborating or assistive robots, domain randomization can be used to bridge the sim2real gap to deal with the variability across different subjects without personalizing the human models, e.g., training an exoskeleton controller with domain randomization in simulations that can be immediately deployed in real rehabilitation robotics applications and robustly operate for different subjects.
    
    This proposed workshop is a second human modeling workshop as a follow-up activity of the first human modeling workshop focused on physical human-robot interaction at ICRA 2024 by the same organizers, who also organized a special issue on the same topic on the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters in 2023. While these previous activities tried to bring the attention of relevant communities to the significance of human modeling for building cohesive and symbiotic human-robot collaborative systems, the proposed follow-up workshop attempts to focus on harnessing the power of AI to make the actual impact of human modeling on individuals’ daily lives.
    
    To achieve that, the workshop aims to stimulate and facilitate the interconnection and cross-pollination between the areas of biomechanics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and robotics. The workshop topics of interest are described by the following keywords:
    
    - Personalization of human neuromusculoskeletal model
    - Personalization of human motor control model
    - Personalization of human response to robot behavior
    - Physical human-robot interaction modeling and control
    - Physical human-robot interaction simulation
    - Deep reinforcement learning for human motor control modeling
    - Domain randomization for sim2real transfer
    - Model-based and data-driven human modeling
    - Standardization of human biosensing and modeling

- Workshop on Multimodal Robot Learning in Physical Worlds (MRLPW), 仿真与动画, 操作规划, 迁移学习
    
    https://internrobotics.shlab.org.cn/workshop/2025/
    
    The rapid progress in foundation models has brought us closer to realizing stable and versatile robots, yet critical challenges remain—from data scarcity and generalizability to multimodal fusion (vision, language, and action) and scalable learning paradigms. This workshop aims to convene leaders in robotics, computer vision, and language modeling to explore these frontiers through insightful talks and exchange of views. Our workshop focuses on the theme of building generalizable robotic intelligence through simulated and real-world interactions. The issues include, but are not limited to:
    
    - Efficient learning paradigms of embodied foundation models
    - Vision-language-based control tasks (manipulation and navigation)
    - Bridging the high-fidelity simulation and the real world
    - Multimodal fusion (language + vision + action) and cross-domain generalization
    - Next-generation embodied intelligence benchmark tasks and evaluation metrics design
    
    We will also introduce a challenge featuring two tracks: (1) vision-language manipulation and (2) vision-language navigation in physical environments. Both tracks have two stages: the first stage will be conducted online using the high-fidelity simulation platform
    
    [InternUtopia](https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/GRUtopia)
    
    . The top-performing teams in Stage 1 will advance to the second stage, competing in real-world offline scenarios. These challenges aim to benchmark progress in learning paradigms, generalization to novel scenarios, and fidelity in instruction following through navigation and manipulation tasks. A dedicated session on the workshop day will recognize challenge winners, highlighting their methodologies and results. We hope this workshop can unite researchers and practitioners to explore cutting-edge solutions for interactive and multimodal embodied foundation models.

    Dynamic Environments
    Autonomous robots face significant challenges in dynamic environments - where robots operate alongside humans or interact with other robots. Factors such as uncertainty, partial observability, and unexpected disturbances in dynamic environments can severely limit the effectiveness of traditional planning and control framework. The ever-changing nature poses a great challenge to learning-based algorithms, as building a comprehensive dataset or simulator is nearly impossible. In addition, interaction with human teammates or multiple robots introduces additional complexity, including intent inference, safety constraints, and context-aware behavior. Dynamic environments further emphasize the increasing demands on the real-time reactivity of the planner, the smoothness of the generated trajectories, and the coherency of the decision. Together, these demands make the design of robust, scalable autonomous robots a painstakingly difficult challenge.
    
    The workshop, LeaPRiDE, aims to bring researchers and practitioners from the human-robot interaction, multi-agent interaction, and robot learning communities to explore the latest advances, identify key challenges, share common concepts, and forge collaborations for autonomous robots operating in dynamic environments. By covering this broad spectrum of topics, LeaPRiDE seeks to inspire new research directions and foster synergy across domains, ultimately paving the way for more capable, adaptable, and trustworthy robotic systems.

- Perception and Navigation for Autonomous Heavy Machines, 海洋/现场机器人
    
    https://autonomous-heavy-vehicles.github.io/autonomous-heavy-vehicles/
    
    ## Overview
    
    Perception and Navigation for Autonomous Heavy Machines in Shared Environments
    
    Automation is rapidly advancing in off-road industries, creating an urgent need for research on autonomy in unstructured and dynamic environments. Autonomous heavy vehicles --- such as trucks, excavators, and loaders --- are transforming construction, mining, and logistics by improving safety, efficiency, and reliability. However, deploying these systems presents three major challenges: perception in harsh environments, navigation across unstructured terrains, and human-vehicle collaboration in shared workspaces. Perception systems struggle to detect and classify obstacles in harsh conditions such as fog and uneven lighting. Navigation and motion planning must address difficulties in planning safe and efficient trajectories on slippery, muddy, or uneven terrains, while considering vehicles size, weight, and limited maneuverability. As autonomous systems are often deployed alongside human-driven machines and in human-populated environments, human-vehicle collaboration in shared workspaces poses additional safety and efficiency challenges.
    
    This workshop will bring together robotics researchers and industry experts to address these challenges, with a focus on reliable perception, adaptive motion planning, and human-aware autonomy. Unlike previous workshops that have primarily focused on ur- ban driving, structured industrial settings, or general field robotics, this event will specif- ically target the challenges of autonomous off-road heavy vehicle in highly un- structured and shared environments.
    
    This workshop aligns closely with IROS 2025s mission to advance cutting-edge robotics research and expand the focus on autonomous heavy vehicles — an un- derrepresented yet high-impact robotics domain. By integrating perspectives from academia and industry, this event will contribute to shaping future research direc- tions and provide collaborative opportunities to accelerate the real-world deployment of autonomous heavy vehicles.

    Over the past decades, surgical robotics has evolved from a specialized research field to a cornerstone of innovation in precision medicine. Continuum robots, with their unique ability to navigate within complex and narrow anatomical structures, offer unprecedented access to small and remote areas of the body. By integrating environmental adaptability, task operation capabilities, and intelligent decision-making, these robots enable targeted therapies with enhanced accuracy and much reduced invasiveness. This workshop aims to address the latest theoretical and engineering advances in continuum robotic systems and allied technologies in control, materials science, and fabrication technologies. It also bridges the gap between early detection of precursor lesions and the delivery of precise interventions by leveraging molecular, organ, and system-level information. Emphases will be placed on the development of fiber-embodied miniaturized continuum robots, which hold promise for revolutionizing surgical techniques. Participants will explore the latest advancements in robotic design, control systems, and clinical applications, with a focus on improving safety, efficiency, and functional outcomes. This event will bring together researchers, clinicians, and engineers to discuss challenges, share insights, and foster collaboration in this rapidly evolving field. By pushing the frontiers of precision surgery, continuum robots are poised to address critical unmet needs in healthcare and unlock new possibilities for minimally invasive treatments.

    # Context
    
    Event-based cameras are bio-inspired visual sensors that mimic the transient pathway of the human visual system, offering key advantages (e.g., microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range) that hold the potential to revolutionize robot state estimation and image processing. Since the first commercially available event camera in 2008 and the first Workshop on Event-based Vision at ICRA 2017, the community has witnessed a surge in event-based/-enhanced solutions for robotics and computer vision. However, the community is facing a chicken-and-egg dilemma: on one hand, the high price of event cameras stifles the community growth; on the other hand, the absence of large-scale deployment of event-based solutions discourages mass production of these cameras. To this end, this workshop is dedicated to event-based vision, with a particular focus on its development in state estimation and image processing.
    
    This workshop builds on the tradition of inviting pioneering figures in the community as speakers, while also serving as a bridge between international/domestic start-ups and academia. It aims to promote discussions on identifying roadblocks that hinder progress in the field and foster collaborative solutions to overcome these barriers. Besides, the first-ever Event-based SLAM Challenge will be held in this workshop. This challenge seeks to benchmark state-of-the-art algorithms, encourage innovation in event-driven/-enhanced approaches, and push the boundaries of what is achievable in real-time ultra-frame-rate state estimation for high-speed robots. As a whole, this workshop will place a strong emphasis on the reproducibility of research findings in real-world scenarios and their tangible impact on advancing robotics technology

- Robot Learning From Human Teleoperation, 遥操作, 示教学习, 灵巧操作
    
    https://sites.google.com/view/lfht-iros25-workshop-proposal/home
    
    Overview
    Imitation Learning (IL) from human teleoperation has emerged as a powerful approach for training robotic systems in complex manipulation tasks. However, challenges remain in developing effective strategies for data collection, ensuring standardization across diverse teleoperation setups, and integrating tactile sensing for improved learning from demonstration (LfD). This workshop will bring together leading researchers and practitioners to explore these key challenges, addressing the question: What are the best strategies to collect and standardize teleoperation data, and what is the role of tactile sensing and  haptic feedback in LfD?
    
    Featuring expert speakers, the workshop will present insights on best practices for designing teleoperation interfaces, curating high-quality datasets, and leveraging tactile feedback for enhanced imitation learning.

- Open World Navigation in Human-centric Environments, 自动驾驶导航, 故障恢复, 深度学习
    
    https://adacompnus.github.io/open-world-navigation-25/
    
    Can a robot be deployed anywhere in the world, then navigate its surroundings zero-shot to reach a goal? Navigation in the open world remains an elusive grail of robotics, owing to the sheer diversity of environments, agents and scenarios a robot can encounter. With the rise of foundation models, robots have attained unprecedented levels of generalization, enabling progress toward open world navigation. Yet training data is bounded, making it almost certain robots will encounter unexpected, out-of-distribution scenarios. Thus achieving open world navigation requires taking a path that balances improving generalization with out-of-distribution handling. Recent workshops have focused on individual elements of this, such as applications of LLMs/VLMs to navigation or robot failure management. In contrast, this workshop seeks to provide a timely and unique perspective on system design for open world navigation, that unites the application of increasingly powerful and general foundation models with explicit consideration of failures and out-of-distribution scenarios.
    
    In particular, this workshop aims to answer the questions:
    
    How do we build generalizable systems for open world navigation with foundation models?
    How do we detect failures of such systems, particularly for scenarios that are out-of-distribution for learned/foundation models?
    What strategies can be employed to mitigate failures or recover from them?
    What are suitable benchmarks to gauge progress in open world navigation?
    
    Call for Videos
    We are accepting short videos related to the challenges or failure modes of robot navigation systems in the open world, which we will screen during the workshop. Please refer to the Call for Videos for more details.

- 4th Sensorimotor-Augmented Teleoperation, 遥操作, 人机协作
    
    https://sites.google.com/view/iros-workshop-4th-sat-2025
    
    ## **Overview**
    
    Teleoperation systems are evolving beyond traditional interfaces by integrating sensorimotor augmentation to align with human proprioceptive and cognitive capabilities. While advancements in robotics and AI have improved remote operations, challenges persist in reducing cognitive load, enhancing situational awareness, and ensuring intuitive human-robot collaboration. This workshop introduces a paradigm shift toward human-interaction-oriented (HIO) frameworks, integrating multimodal sensory feedback (such as haptic and proprioceptive systems) with adaptive motor control strategies. This approach aims to effectively bridge the gap between human intent and robotic execution, enhancing synergy in interactive applications.
    
    ## **Aim & Scope**
    
    Unlike previous workshops focused on unilateral teleoperation, this event uniquely explores sensorimotor integration across diverse applications—surgery, marine exploration, and nuclear decommissioning, where human adaptability and real-time feedback are critical. Topics include:
    
    - Multimodal sensory fusion for enriched operator perception.
    - Motor control augmentation via AI-driven exoskeletons and VR/AR interfaces.
    - Human adaptability to dynamic teleoperation environments.
    
    The half-day workshop features 5 confirmed speakers from academia and industry, an amazing Mentor-Mentee Network (MMN) fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration, and interactive demos of cutting-edge devices (e.g., haptic gloves, vision-based tactile sensors). By integrating robotics, neuroscience, and human-computer interaction disciplines, this workshop seeks to reconceptualize teleoperation through human-centered sensorimotor enhancements. These advancements are designed to foster innovations in robotic systems, prioritizing safety and intuitive interaction to enable next-generation collaborative frameworks for human-robot partnerships.

    ## **Overview**
    
    Avatar robots enhance remote individuals’ capabilities. They can transcend geographical constraints (beyond space) by controlling multiple avatars simultaneously and move from one location to another instantaneously (beyond time) by connecting to avatars in different locales. However, several technical and knowledge gaps stand in the way of realizing this vision, including legal and ethical guidelines, knowledge of how people interact with and through avatar robots, and development of avatar robot systems and their interfaces.
    
    This workshop continues to serve as a pivotal forum for ad-dressing these issues. We aim to bring together experts from human-robot interaction, robotics, psychology, sociology, and industry, and provide them a place to gather and discuss the latest advancements and challenges in avatar technology. By fostering dialogue and collaboration, this workshop will pave the way toward a symbiotic society where avatars seamlessly integrate into our social fabric.

    # **IROS 2025 Workshop: Towards Sustainability and Resiliency of Field Robotics**
    
    Deploying robots in the field without ethical considerations can cause ecological disruption. As we strive towards developing more autonomous and resilient robotic systems, it is imperative to ensure that these advancements do not come at the expense of ecological health. The integration of sustainable practices within resilient robotic systems represents a frontier that must be navigated with caution and foresight. By focusing on energy-efficient designs, eco-friendly material utilization, and strategies for minimizing ecological footprint during deployment, we can pave the way for a harmonious coexistence between robotics and the natural world.
    
    The intersection of AI and robotics holds great promise for sustainable field deployment, aiming at minimize environmental impact while optimizing resource use across multiple domains, such as agricultural automation, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and mining. In light of this, bringing together experts from academia and industry, we aim to address scientific and technical questions such as: How can AI-powered robots enhance ecological sustainability in field applications? What materials and designs are most conducive to reducing the environmental impact of robotic systems? How can we trade off the resiliency in swarm robotics and potential increase in material usage? By fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and innovation, our workshop seeks to contribute to the development of robotic systems that are not only technologically advanced but also environmentally responsible.

- Multi-Agent Cooperative Systems and Swarm Robotics in the Era of Generative AI, 多机器人系统, 蜂群机器人, 深度学习
    
    https://macrai2025.github.io/
    
    The field of multi-agent cooperative systems and swarm robotics has advanced rapidly, particularly in autonomous driving, where large-scale datasets and algorithm breakthroughs have improved vehicle coordination. Multi-agent coordination in robotics has also seen progress in applications like search-and-rescue and industrial automation, enhancing adaptability in dynamic environments. However, challenges remain in real-time perception, communication efficiency, and cooperative decision-making. Existing frameworks often rely on predefined models and handcrafted policies, which struggle to generalize to diverse, unstructured scenarios. Recent advances in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, enabling adaptive policy learning and bridging the gap between simulation and reality. These developments also enhance human-robot interaction and coordination. While recent workshops have focused on LLMs and generative AI in single-agent tasks, this workshop introduces a new perspective by integrating generative AI with multi-agent systems. Through talks, posters, and panels, we aim to foster discussions on data-efficient learning, communication-aware cooperation, and scalable deployment, bridging research with real-world multi-agent applications.

- Neuromorphic Perception for Real World Robotics (NeuRobots), 神经机器人学, 仿生机器人学习
    
    https://sites.google.com/view/NeuRobots2025
    
    Scope and Motivation
    
    Neuromorphic perception offers low-power and low-latency with sparse encoding and inherent information compression. Such perception for robots can potentially increase reactivity in an unconstrained and dynamic environment (i.e. avoid obstacles and grasp dynamic objects), improve mobility by reducing power requirements and reliance on off-board GPU servers, and integrate with biologically inspired artificial intelligence. In the visual domain, event-based sensors facilitate the accurate state estimation of fast-moving robots and objects by eliminating motion blur and data redundancy, thereby enhancing precision during actions. The high-dynamic range increases the robustness and reliability of robots in challenging lighting conditions. The reduction of data in a stationary environment, eliminates the need for computational resources and battery power, further enhancing the capabilities of this technology.
    
    This workshop focuses on real-world applications and demonstrations of event-based cameras and neuromorphic sensors, including perception pipelines and data processing, that go beyond those solely tested in simulated environments. The potential of neuromorphic sensors in robotics has motivated a growing body of literature for solutions to robotic problems, but the amount of work that actually demonstrates the advantages of neuromorphic perception over traditional perception in real-world scenarios still needs to be shown. We encourage the participation and discussion of real-world robotic implementations, task-dependent applications, hybrid (neuromorphic and traditional sensors as well as comparisons between such sensors) systems, and online and real-time algorithms shown in real-world conditions. During the workshop we will discuss the current experimental trends, difficulties, and general solutions for achieving real-world neuromorphic perception for robots.

- Beyond R,r,reply- Articles Towards evidence based measurable robotics research
    
    http://www.reproducibleroboticsresearch.org/RArticlesIROS2025/
    
    ## **Scope**
    
    Reproducibility in robotics is still not mainstream. This situation hampers both the research process and the technology transfer of research results. Reproducibility of results is the cornerstone of the scientific method on which modern engineering is based. This workshop will introduce the attendees to the most recent techniques, methodologies and best practices to be applied to make robotics research reproducible and measurable.
    
    The workshop will collect from the community both i) r-articles (experimental replications) starting from published R-articles from IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine (RAM) – the first and so far only robotics publishing venue managing a reproducible article process - and ii) ‘plans’ to submit R-Articles. R-These last are scientific papers describing a specific system/methodology with a particular emphasis on reproducibility of results: each R-Article is associated to a publicly available dataset with all the material required to replicate the experiments presented in the paper (code, collected experimental data, description of the hw/sw platform, instructions, …). Anybody willing to reproduce the experiments presented in a R-Article should then describe his/her own results in a r-article, to confirm or refute the original results.
    
    The workshop will propose some methods for objective operational measuring of intelligent robot behaviors and will collect and discuss new ideas from the community. Through this workshop, participants will gain both a deep appreciation of reproducibility’s critical role and practical tools for its realization in robotic tasks. The event will issue a call for reproducible articles and expression on interests (in form of extended 4-pages abstract) to write R-articles for IEEE RAM.

    # **Abstract**
    
    # 
    
    # 
    
    This workshop focuses on safe motion coordination and guidance for mobile robots by leveraging the latest advancements in Guiding Vector Fields (GVFs) to ensure formal guarantees. The primary objective is to introduce a robotic guidance strategy so that engineers and researchers can seamlessly integrate it with complex robot dynamics, even in challenging environments requiring obstacle and multi-robot collision avoidance. Guiding Vector Fields are a purely reactive strategy, eliminating the need for optimization, thereby making it ideal for real-time applications or systems with limited computational power. Mathematically, the approach is guaranteed to be free of singularities, even when navigating self-intersecting paths or operating in three-dimensional spaces. Additionally, the method is compatible with consensus algorithms, enabling coordinated motion and emergent behavior on both paths and surfaces. The workshop will present the mathematical foundations of GVFs, share practical insights from real-world implementations with drones, and offer a tutorial on how it is implemented in an open-source autopilot.

    ## Abstract
    
    Computational neuroscience provides powerful methodologies to address one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time: understanding how the nervous system controls behavior. Models of the nervous system allow for exploring the roles of neural circuits in sensory processing, cognition, behavior generation, and motor control. However, understanding how the nervous system controls behavior is impossible without the consideration of the body it evolved to function within. Embodiment addresses this critical aspect by closing the perception-action loop through real-world physical interactions. Robotics and physics-simulators effectively help bridge this gap by providing physical embodiment to computational neural models, facilitating tangible interactions with the environment. Furthermore, biological neural circuits have evolved to develop robust solutions to challenges that closely parallel those in robotics, including motor learning, adaptation to novel settings, robust locomotion, and navigation in complex environments. Harnessing solutions refined over millions of years of evolution, thus, holds immense potential to inspire the next breakthroughs in robotics.
    
    This workshop at IROS 2025 brings together roboticists leveraging computational neuroscience to address robotics challenges and neuroscientists using robots to study neural function. Unlike previous related events, this workshop introduces cutting-edge approaches in neuroAI, neuromorphic engineering, embodied neural computation, and bio-inspired robotics to enhance the real-world applicability and robustness of robotic systems. The workshop promotes interdisciplinary collaboration, advancing fundamental understanding in neuroscience while simultaneously fostering innovative, bio-inspired solutions to contemporary robotic challenges.

    # Introduction
    
    Robotics and AI have become fundamental drivers transforming global industries, including agriculture. The agricultural sector, however, faces unique challenges due to its inherently unstructured environments, hindering the widespread adoption of these technologies.
    
    Simultaneously, the global demand for food, fiber, and fuel continues to rise, driven by population growth and evolving consumer needs. The agricultural sector faces numerous challenges in meeting this demand, including limited arable land, labor shortages, health and safety risks associated with farm work (e.g., chemical exposure, repetitive motion injuries, and ladder falls), and the adverse effects of climate change. Recent advancements in AI, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT) have led to intelligent farming systems capable of precise monitoring, crop management optimization, and automated harvesting. Technologies such as autonomous navigation, robotic harvesting and weeding, precision chemical applications, and livestock automation (e.g., robotic milking and shearing) are demonstrating significant potential to transform agriculture.
    
    This workshop aims to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration among experts from agricultural engineering, robotics, and AI research communities. By promoting knowledge exchange and showcasing cutting-edge research and applications, the event seeks to accelerate the development and adoption of AI-driven robotic technologies, ultimately ensuring a more efficient, sustainable, and resilient agri-food system.

- Exploring the Role of Energy in Robot Learning and Control, 机器学习
    
    https://sites.google.com/view/e-rlc2025
    
    # Abstract
    
    In recent years robotics has been increasingly focusing on the transition of robots from industrial cages to unstructured environments. This shift aims to achieve stable and safe execution of complex tasks in dynamic and unpredictable settings. Energy-based methods, such as passive controllers, have emerged as promising solutions, as the stability of closed-loop systems is, in principle, independent of external environmental interactions. At the same time, recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have gained significant interest, positioning AI techniques as promising tools for designing controllers capable of handling complex tasks in unknown environments. However, these approaches struggle to guarantee stability and safety, critical in human-robot interaction, and they require large amounts of data, which is usually prohibitive for robotic applications. Energy is a fundamental concept across various engineering and scientific disciplines, and it has the potential to facilitate communication between AI experts and control theorists. It simplifies the analysis of complex systems by breaking them into subsystems, where their combined energies determine overall behavior. These principles not only enhance the understanding of control actions but also support stability analysis. This workshop seeks to explore the role that energy can play in the ongoing transformation of robotics. Moreover, it aims to investigate how energy principles can be harnessed to bridge the gap between AI and traditional robot modeling and control to overcome their respective limitations and unlock new, promising capabilities.

- 2nd Workshop and Competition on Multi-Robot Perception and Navigation Challenges, 多机器人系统, 飞行系统应用与感知
    
    https://www.panlogin.com/
    
    ## **Abstract:**
    
    In the pursuit of sustainable development, the efficient management of logistics and the reliable inspection of critical infrastructure are paramount. Multi-robot systems offer promising solutions to address these challenges by enhancing operational efficiency, reducing environmental impact, and ensuring the safety and reliability of essential infrastructure. Advancements in multi-robot systems, including autonomous car fleets, drones swarm for inspection, and logistic robot systems, hold promise for enhancing daily life by improving automation efficiency.
    
    However, deploying robotic systems in groups poses challenges such as cost-effective perception implementation, dealing with measurement uncertainties, real-time dynamic planning, and interactions with other agents. Developing such multi-robot perception and navigation systems is often time- and resource-demanding, rendering this field less explored by the majority of the academic community. We identify a significant domain gap in this area that has yet to be fulfilled.
    
    Through collaborative learning, hands-on challenges, and discussions on real-world applications, participants will gain valuable insights and tools to drive innovation in robotics, ultimately contributing to creating more sustainable and resilient societies. We anticipate that user-friendly, cost-effective simula-tion evaluation environments will enhance access to explo-ration, planning, and control research and accelerate progress through quantitative comparisons to existing benchmarks.

- FAST: Fully Autonomy Emerges from Situational CogniTion, 自动化
    
    https://sites.google.com/view/iros2025fastworkshop
    
    ## **Overview**
    
    Situation cognition in driving is the active perception and prediction of the intentions and future behaviors of involving agents and facilitating the inference of spatiotemporal constraint for behavior decision-making, motion planning, and motion control of autonomous vehicles. In the workshop, we would like to discuss how recent advances in situation cognition from the AI communities could benefit driving autonomy research, e.g., incorporating foundation models, scene graphs, causal theory, etc., potentially facilitating fully autonomy of driving systems and enhancing the interpretability, safety, robustness, and generalizable ability of autonomous vehicles.
    
    Nowadays, the situation cognition computing in the open traffic world faces various environmental disturbances, causal confusion, and various physical properties and rules. Current paradigms fall short of the traffic situation reasoning that vehicles need to consider, such as human experience, real-world knowledge, situation causal relations, etc. These issues may be alleviated by integration with driving systems, where real-world driving experiences that contain rich sensory input and introspection can potentially bring driving autonomy to the next level.
    
    The workshop aims to create an inclusive and collaborative platform for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts alike to exchange ideas, share experiences, and foster meaningful connections within the autonomous driving community. It will feature a mix of presentations, open panel discussions, and results and demos from our Visual-CognitiveAccident-Understanding (Cog-AU) competition challenge. Five invited speakers will share their related research, thoughts, and experiences at the intersection of autonomous systems, with broad coverage of topics such as available datasets, benchmarks, closedloop driving, foundation models, and more.
    
    ## **Call for Papers**
    
    Autonomous driving has the dual attributes of strategic technology and emerging industry and has long been highly concerned by local governments, industry, and academia. In recent years, continuous breakthroughs in learning technology have pushed autonomous vehicles into a new stage of development. In this way, existing autonomous driving systems still cannot omit manual supervision. Driven by the increasing scale of model parameters (e.g., LLMs, VLMs) and the massive expansion of data, deep learning technology promotes the continuous iterative upgrade of driving system performance along three technical routes: modular cascade, end-to-end perception-decision integrated model, and foundation model empowerment. However, bottlenecks such as interpretability, generalization, robustness, and causal confusion still exist and are increasingly obvious, seriously affecting the industrialization process of autonomous driving systems.
    
    Traffic scenes are uncertain and open. The human driving process is a dynamic process that continuously recognizes the traffic situation and generates driving behaviors, which is obviously different from the current perception-to-control calculation process of autonomous driving. Humans learn, interpret, reason, and remember situations and corresponding driving operations from their interactions with real traffic environments, conduct inductive reasoning, summarize common sense rules, and accumulate driving experience. When humans drive, the process of triggering driving behavior by the current traffic situation is the result of cognitive mapping between human experience and the current situation.
    
    How to transfer the scene semantics, abstract representations, and mapping mechanisms of driving experience formed by humans to autonomous driving systems, so that they can recognize and respond to highly dynamic and highly random traffic situations like humans? Obviously, the "representation+calculation" paradigm followed by current data-driven deep learning cannot adapt to the closed-loop characteristics of intelligent driving perception-motion, especially the unique introspection and reflection mechanism of human driving strategy learning. This requires exploring new types of autonomous driving systems with human-like cognitive mechanisms (abstract representation of situations and human-like policy generation for introspection and reflection) from the perspective of computational thinking.
    
    The workshop aims to create an inclusive and collaborative platform for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts alike to exchange ideas, share experiences, and foster meaningful connections within the human-like autonomous driving field. It will feature a mix of presentations, open panel discussions, and results and demos from our VisualCognitive-Accident-Understanding (Cog-AU) competition challenge to facilitate the development of safety-critical driving scene understanding. In this challenge, we plan to host the challenge over the span of a few months before IROS 2025 and present the first stage of results at the workshop. We will release a novel human-gaze-aligned egocentric accident video benchmark collected in driving scenes. Specifically, the benchmark contains well-annotated human-gaze maps, object bounding boxes, accident videos, text descriptions of accident reasons, prevention advice, and accident types. The challenge will be open to anyone interested in the field to participate and we will summarize the results and invite the winning teams to present their work at the workshop. More information on the Cog-AU Challenge can be found on the workshop website.
    
    Five invited speakers will discuss their related research, thoughts, and experiences in various aspects at the intersection of AI and autonomous driving systems, with broad coverage of topics such as available datasets, benchmarks, software stacks, world models, spatial reasoning, foundation models, and more. Additionally, this workshop **calls for workshop papers to absorb cutting-edge works** with poster presentations.

- 2nd Workshop on AI Meets Autonomy: Vision, Language, and Autonomous Systems, 人工智能机器人, 语义场景理解
    
    https://www.ai-meets-autonomy.com/
    
    ## Event Details
    
    With the rising popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), Visual Language Models (VLMs), and other general foundation models, the 2nd iteration of this workshop aims to explore the synergy between these models and robotics, in the context of recent developments. In the workshop, we will discuss how recent advances from the AI and CV communities could benefit robotics research – incorporating LLMs and VLMs in robotic systems could potentially make the systems more explainable, instructable, and generalizable. However, seamlessly integrating the two is still an open problem, as existing LLMs and VLMs often fall short of the real-world knowledge that roboticists need to consider, such as the physical properties, spatial relations, temporal relations, etc. in an environment. These issues may be alleviated by integration with robotic systems, where real-world experiences that contain rich sensory input and physical feedback can potentially bridge the gap for physically grounded systems.
    
    This workshop aims to create an inclusive and collaborative platform for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts alike to exchange ideas, share experiences, and foster meaningful connections within the AI and robotics community, with a focus on connecting early-career researchers. It will feature a mix of presentations, open panel discussions, networking, and exclusive results and demonstrations from our [CMU Vision-Language-Autonomy](https://www.ai-meets-autonomy.com/cmu-vla-challenge) challenge competition.  Five invited speakers will discuss their related research, ideas, and future plans in various topics at the intersection of AI and autonomous systems, with a broad coverage of topics such as: datasets/benchmarks, software stacks, visual-language navigation, situated reasoning, robotics foundation models, and more.
    
    See [AI Meets Autonomy 2024](https://www.ai-meets-autonomy.com/iros-workshop-2024) for the previous iteration of our workshop at IROS 2024 and past talk recordings.
    
    ## Content
    
    There are a variety of ongoing efforts to improve the **state-of-the-art in robot autonomy** using recent advances in AI, particularly using large **foundation models**, including new developments in areas such as human-robot interaction, vision-language navigation, multi-task planning, and knowledge acquisition and reasoning. Although integrating AI and autonomous systems has multiple advantages, it also involves issues and challenges. First, large language or visual foundation models are shown to be insufficient in understanding the actual physics, spatial relationships, and causal relationships, lacking the physical grounding that’s critical to most robotic tasks. Second, deploying these large models on robotic systems requires intense GPU resources, especially if the processing needs to be real-time. Further, existing work combining LLMs/VLMs and robotics focuses on using LLMs/VLMs as a tool to translate human instructions into executable plans. In reality, humans can provide more than instructions—such as explanation of the scene and correction of execution errors, and in richer contexts such as multi-turn dialogues. The workshop will focus on the current research work being done to tackle such challenges in the field of robotics with a diverse line-up of speakers. The speakers will each share their recent work and experiences with integrating vision and language methods into various autonomous systems and their active research projects in this area from the perspective of both academia and industry. The speakers will cover a wide range of topics they have expertise in, such as **generalist embodied agents, vision-language-navigation, world modeling, robotics foundation models, and situated dialogue agents**. Their talks and subsequent discussions will not only give a concrete picture of the current and rapidly developing research landscape, but also promote new insights and directions for future work. Q&A sessions after each talk as well as a panel discussion at the end of the workshop will allow the audience to engage with speakers and discuss ideas.
    
    Another key barrier to integrating vision and language learning methods into robotics systems is the resources required for testing new methods, including the data needed for training and evaluation, or **robust real-world robot platforms** to test deployment. To lower the barrier, we have been hosting the [CMU Vision-Language-Autonomy Challenge](http://www.ai-meets-autonomy.com/cmu-vla-challenge). In the challenge, we provide a set of language questions, sample training environments, and a full pipeline for integrating any vision-language method for object-centric indoor navigation with a real-world ground vehicle running an autonomy stack with an onboard 3D LiDAR sensor and 360-degree camera. Challenge participants can conduct development and integration in a simulator and eventually deploy on our real robot system, which will be demoed at the workshop. All code, autonomy stacks, and resources used for the challenge are open-sourced and the challenge is open to anyone. The challenge ran in simulation last year and initial results were presented at IROS 2024 during the previous iteration of our workshop. In the next few months, we are hosting round two of the challenge on our real-robot system and plan to present the results during this workshop alongside a **live and interactive demonstration of the system** where audience members are invited to participate. This not only gives top participants–often consisting of students–a chance to spotlight their work to our diverse and global workshop audience but will also help garner interest in this workshop in the months leading up to it. **It also provides a unique opportunity for IROS 2025 to be the venue at which the final challenge results are shared for the first time**. The inclusion of an interactive system demonstration and spotlight talks on the competition results will differentiate our workshop from others at IROS 2025 and create a more engaging workshop experience.
    
    In summary, the workshop will not only have five invited leading researchers present on their relevant work, but we will also invite the top challenge teams to present their results in the form of poster sessions and short spotlight talks, and include an interactive demo of the challenge system. Speakers will also engage in a panel session where attendees can ask questions to the speakers and engage in discussion. **The workshop will conclude with an open networking session and the ability for attendees to share their profile and resume in a compiled contact book to encourage forming connections beyond the span of the workshop.**
    
    The topics we expect to cover through talks, challenge results, panel discussions, and networking span an incredibly diverse range across the field of robotics while also intersecting with many other disciplines. It will demonstrate how the integration of robotics, language and vision can and will enhance robotics research in a variety of real-world application areas.
    
    Topics of discussion and open questions include but are not limited to the following:
    
    - Vision-Language-Action datasets and models
    - Foundation models for robotics
    - Human-robot interaction for navigation
    - Human-robot collaboration and dialogue agents

    # **Abstract**
    
    Shared autonomy is revolutionizing Human-Robot interaction by seamlessly blending human intent with robot abilities. This paradigm holds the potential to enhance user performance and experience across various applications, from remote manipulation to assistive technologies, like prostheses. However, a critical challenge remains:
    
    **how can we modulate robot autonomy to reduce user effort while preserving the user's sense of agency?**
    
    This workshop seeks to address this question by providing an overview about the link between shared autonomy and the sense of agency, starting from neuroscientific foundations and covering various application fields that share the common aspect of controlling external elements (prosthetics, teleoperation, etc.).
    
    To address this, the workshop aims to explore four key aspects:
    
    - **Understanding sense of agency and embodiment**: Which are the neuroscientific bases underlying the concepts of sense of agency, embodiment, and ownership?
    - **Understanding shared autonomy**: What is shared autonomy?
    - **Insight into how shared autonomy affects agency**: How does shared autonomy between humans and robotic agents influence the sense of agency?
    - **Promoting sense of agency through the sensory feedback**: How can communication channels be effectively leveraged to enhance situational awareness, reduce cognitive load, and create a more natural control experience?
    
    Designing safe, efficient, and user-friendly human-machine control systems requires a deep understanding of how individuals experience agency and how it impacts their behavior. During the past years, various workshops at the main conferences in robotics have addressed topics such as sensory feedback and shared autonomy in Human-Robot interaction. This workshop brings a novel and multidisciplinary perspective by exploring these aspects from the viewpoint of the sense of agency. We invite researchers to engage in discussions on these topics, fostering a collaborative environment to advance the state of shared autonomy.

    Advancements in human-robot collaboration, particularly in the fields of prosthetics, exoskeletons, and other robot assisted systems, are transforming healthcare. Key to these innovations are technologies that enable safe, efficient, and intuitive interactions between humans and robots. This workshop will explore critical aspects of human-robot collaboration, focusing on inferring human intent in contact-rich, collaborative scenarios, improving grasping models, and developing metrics that reduce exertion for both humans and robots. These areas of research aim to unlock anthropomorphic motion capabilities, facilitating seamless integration of robots into human environments.
    
    A central objective of the workshop is to explore how machines can predict user movements through underlying kinetic and kinematic mechanics, ensuring stability and safety in complex, contact-intensive interactions. Special emphasis will be placed on how anticipatory behaviors can be incorporated into redundant robotic systems to enhance adaptability and robustness. These advancements are designed to minimize cognitive and physical load on users while maximizing robot performance, improving rehabilitation and assistance outcomes.
    
    The workshop serves as a collaborative platform for experts in biomechanics and robotics, promoting dynamic exchanges of knowledge. By bridging these fields, participants will explore novel strategies for creating user-centric robotic systems that are safe, efficient, and supportive.
